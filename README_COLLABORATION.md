# 🤝 Enhanced Collaboration System

## 🎯 What's New

Your collaboration system now supports **staged changes** for normal users! Here's what this means:

### ✅ **For Admins** (You)
- **Full Control**: Create projects, invite users, edit directly
- **Review Power**: Approve or reject user changes before they go live
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all content meets your standards
- **Easy Management**: Visual indicators show which projects need review

### 👥 **For Normal Users** (Collaborators)
- **Safe Editing**: Can make changes without breaking anything
- **Staged Changes**: Their edits are saved but not published until approved
- **Clear Feedback**: Know exactly what happens to their contributions
- **Easy Participation**: Simple interface to contribute to projects

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   ./start-collaboration.sh
   ```

2. **Login as admin**:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `Admin123!`

3. **Create a project** and invite users

4. **Test the workflow**:
   ```bash
   node test-collaboration.js
   ```

## 🔄 How It Works

### The Collaboration Workflow:

1. **Admin creates project** → Project is live and ready
2. **Admin invites users** → Users get invitation notifications  
3. **Users accept invitations** → They can now access the project
4. **Users edit content** → Changes are **staged** (not live yet)
5. **Admin reviews changes** → Compare original vs proposed content
6. **Admin approves/rejects** → Approved changes go live immediately

### Visual Indicators:

- 🟠 **Orange badges**: Projects with pending changes
- 🔵 **Blue badges**: Your role (Admin/Owner/Collaborator)
- ⚠️ **Alert icons**: Staged changes waiting for review
